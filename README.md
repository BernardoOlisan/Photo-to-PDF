# Image to PDF with Sockets to send the file

This project is not published or in production, it is development only.

## How to use it
to run it with the sockets or the Airdrop, you must put "npm start", to modify the code of the sockets, "npm run build:client", to run it only the front-end without the sockets, "npm run dev:client"

## Conclusion
You can see all commands in package.json file, also the backend of the python is already host on http://pydocs.pythonanywhere.com/ this is for uploading the images
Airdrop only works on development, the convertor works on both.
